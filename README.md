# Data Projects

Welcome to my "Data Projects" repository! This repository showcases a collection of data-driven projects that aim to demonstrate my proficiency in various tools, technologies, and languages, with the main focus on SQL Server, Python, and Power BI. Each project reflects the practical application of the skills and knowledge I have acquired in terms of data analysis, visualization, and database management. Feel free to explore the projects and review the documentation to gain insights into the techniques and approaches used.
